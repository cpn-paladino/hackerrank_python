## Solution: O(n) Approach

The most direct and efficient approach to solve this problem is to iterate over the array. For each element that is not in its correct position, swap it with the one currently occupying its correct position. Continue this process until each one is in its rightful place and then move on to the next one. This approach guarantees that each element is positioned correctly with a minimal number of swaps
